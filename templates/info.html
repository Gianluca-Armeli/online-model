  <div align="center"><h3>Meaning of the input variables (features)</h3>
 </head> 
 <pre>The features were designed in a way that excludes atoms to be counted multiple times.<br /> This means, if every feature is entered correctly, the exact sum formula of the molecule can be generated from the features.<br />
 For example, the feature 'COC' only asks for the oxygen atom.<br />The related carbon atoms have to be considered separately in their respective features, otherwise there would be carbon atoms missing.</pre>

    <div size="30" style="line-height:1.5" align="center" class="form-group">
    <b>CH3:</b> The number of methyl (CH3) groups.<br />
    <b>CH2:</b> The number of methylen (CH2) groups.<br />
    <b>CH:</b> The number of CH groups.<br />
    <b>C:</b> The number of carbon atoms that are not bonded to any hydrogen atoms.<br />
    <b>OH:</b> The number of hydroxyl groups.<br />
    <b>COC:</b> The number of oxygen atoms with an ether functionality. This accounts only for the oxygen and not for the related carbon atoms.<br />
    <b>C=O:</b> The number of doubly bonded oxygen atoms. This accounts only for the oxygen and not for the other atoms involved.<br />
    <b>N:</b> The number of nitrogen atoms.<br />
    <b>Hal:</b> The number of halogen atoms.<br />
    <b>DBE:</b> The double bond equivalent defined as DBE = 1 + sum(ni (vi - 2)), where ni is the number of atoms with the valence vi.<br />
    <b>Tm:</b> The melting temperature in Kelvin.<br />
